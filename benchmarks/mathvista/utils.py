DEMO_PROMPT = """
Please read the following example. Then extract the answer from the model response and type it at the end of the prompt.

Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.
Question: Which number is missing?

Model response: The number missing in the sequence is 14.

Extracted answer: 14

Hint: Please answer the question requiring a floating-point number with one decimal place and provide the final value, e.g., 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, at the end.
Question: What is the fraction of females facing the camera?

Model response: The fraction of females facing the camera is 0.6, which means that six out of ten females in the group are facing the camera.

Extracted answer: 0.6

Hint: Please answer the question requiring a floating-point number with two decimal places and provide the final value, e.g., 1.23, 1.34, 1.45, at the end.
Question: How much money does Luca need to buy a sour apple candy and a butterscotch candy? (Unit: $)

Model response: Luca needs $1.45 to buy a sour apple candy and a butterscotch candy.

Extracted answer: 1.45

Hint: Please answer the question requiring a Python list as an answer and provide the final list, e.g., [1, 2, 3], [1.2, 1.3, 1.4], at the end.
Question: Between which two years does the line  graph saw its maximum peak?

Model response: The line graph saw its maximum peak between 2007 and 2008.

Extracted answer: [2007, 2008]

Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.
Question: What fraction of the shape is blue?\nChoices:\n(A) 3/11\n(B) 8/11\n(C) 6/11\n(D) 3/5
